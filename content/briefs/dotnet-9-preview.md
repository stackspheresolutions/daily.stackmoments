Microsoft has released the first preview of .NET 9, showcasing significant performance improvements and introducing new language features that promise to enhance developer productivity.

**Key highlights include:**

- **40% faster startup times** for typical web applications
- **Enhanced garbage collection** with reduced memory pressure
- **C# 13 language features** including improved pattern matching
- **Native AOT improvements** for smaller, faster deployments
- **Updated ASP.NET Core** with better minimal API support

The performance gains are particularly notable in cloud-native scenarios, where reduced startup times translate to better scaling efficiency and cost savings.

**Availability:** The preview is available for download now, with the stable release scheduled for November 2024.
