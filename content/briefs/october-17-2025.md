The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initiated proceedings on October 15 to revoke HKT's authorization to operate in US networks, citing national security concerns. The FCC highlighted HKT's affiliation with China Unicom, which lost US network access in 2022, as China Unicom owns an 18.4% stake in PCCW, HKT's parent company. This action follows a broader pattern of FCC moves against Chinese-linked telecommunications companies.

**DJI Appeals Pentagon Blacklist Designation**

Chinese drone manufacturer DJI filed an appeal on October 14 challenging a US federal court ruling that upheld its inclusion on the Pentagon's list of alleged "Chinese military companies". The world's largest commercial drone maker has been fighting the designation since 2022, arguing it is neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military. While a September court ruling found most Pentagon accusations lacked sufficient evidence, DJI remains on the blacklist.

**OpenAI Halts MLK Deepfakes After Estate Complaint**

OpenAI paused the generation of videos featuring Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora platform on October 17 after users created "disrespectful" deepfakes of the civil rights icon.

OpenAI announced it will strengthen guardrails for historical figures and allow estates to opt out of having their likenesses used on Sora.

### **Controversial Proposals**

**Kremlin Pitches "Putin-Trump Tunnel" to Elon Musk**
