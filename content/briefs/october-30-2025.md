## **AI \& Machine Learning**

### **OpenAI Completes Historic For-Profit Restructure**

OpenAI officially completed its transformation from a non-profit to a for-profit Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) on October 28, 2025, marking a pivotal moment in AI commercialization. The restructuring removes previous profit caps for investors and sets the stage for what could be an unprecedented \$1 trillion IPO. Microsoft secured a 27% stake in the newly formed OpenAI Group PBC, valued at approximately \$135 billion, while retaining exclusive access to OpenAI's technology through 2032.

### **NVIDIA Unveils Quantum-AI Integration at GTC 2025**

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced breakthrough quantum computing developments at GTC 2025 in Washington, D.C., introducing NVQLink, a high-speed interconnect system enabling quantum computer control and error correction. The technology connects quantum processing units (QPUs) to GPU supercomputers for hybrid simulations, designed to scale from hundreds of qubits to future systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits. NVIDIA is partnering with 17 quantum computing companies and multiple U.S. Department of Energy labs.

### **Google Partners with Reliance for Massive India AI Rollout**

Google announced a strategic partnership with Reliance Jio to provide free access to Google AI Pro for 18 months to millions of Jio users, valued at ₹35,100 per user. The offering includes Gemini 2.5 Pro, advanced image and video creation tools, NotebookLM research capabilities, and 2TB cloud storage. This partnership positions Google to capture a significant portion of India's AI market while Reliance strengthens its digital services portfolio.

### **Major AI Funding Rounds in India**

Several significant AI funding announcements emerged from India: PointAI (formerly Try ND Buy) secured ₹47 crore in Pre-Series A funding led by Yali Capital, while AI-driven privacy infrastructure startup Redacto raised ₹12 crore to expand its product and engineering teams.

## **Startups \& Funding**

### **Notable Funding Rounds**
