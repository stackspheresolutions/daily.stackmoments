# Tech News for October 23, 2025

Here's a comprehensive roundup of the latest technology news from October 23, 2025, covering major announcements, product launches, and industry developments.

## Major AI and Computing Breakthroughs

### Google's Quantum Computing Milestone

Google achieved a historic breakthrough with its **Willow quantum chip**, demonstrating the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage. The Willow chip ran the "Quantum Echoes" algorithm 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputers, completing calculations that would take classical computers 3.2 years in just over two hours. Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced this breakthrough, published in Nature, could revolutionize drug discovery and materials science by enabling analysis of atomic interactions within molecules.

### OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Atlas Browser

OpenAI entered the browser wars with **ChatGPT Atlas**, an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT. The browser features a ChatGPT sidebar, browser memories that remember browsing context, and an agent mode for automated tasks. Atlas launches globally on macOS today, with Windows, iOS, and Android versions coming soon. However, cybersecurity experts warn about potential security vulnerabilities, including prompt injection attacks that could expose sensitive user data.
### Microsoft Copilot Major Update

Microsoft unveiled significant enhancements to **Copilot**, introducing collaboration features, deeper Google integration, and a new avatar called "Mico". The updated Copilot can now access browser tabs, summarize data, make reservations, and support collaborative workspaces for up to 32 people. These updates aim to compete more effectively with Google Chrome and other AI-powered browsers.

## Consumer Electronics and Mobile Tech

### Samsung Galaxy XR Headset Launch

Samsung officially launched the **Galaxy XR headset** for \$1,799, marking the first Android XR device. Built on the Android XR platform developed with Google and Qualcomm, the headset features micro-OLED displays with 3,552 x 3,840 resolution, Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 processor, and Gemini AI integration. The device is available in the US and South Korea, positioning itself as a more affordable alternative to Apple's \$3,499 Vision Pro.

### Tesla Cybertruck Recall

Tesla recalled 63,619 Cybertrucks due to excessively bright parking lights that could impair other drivers' visibility. The recall affects 2024-2026 model year Cybertrucks with 100% of affected vehicles having the defect. Tesla has already released a free over-the-air software update to resolve the issue.

## Software and App Issues

### Spotify Android App Problems

Spotify acknowledged widespread freezing and crashing issues affecting Android users, particularly on Samsung and Google Pixel devices when connected to Wi-Fi networks. The problem has persisted for two weeks, with the app working normally on mobile data but failing on Wi-Fi connections. Spotify's technical teams are investigating the cause, with speculation that Chromecast-enabled devices may be contributing to the issue.

### Apple iPhone Air Production Cuts

Apple dramatically reduced iPhone Air production to near "end of production" levels due to weak demand. Production orders will drop to less than 10% of September volumes starting in November, despite the phone's thin design and "pro performance" features. The company is redirecting resources to increase production of the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models, which are experiencing stronger demand.

## Industry Developments and Legal News

### Reddit vs. Perplexity Legal Battle

Reddit filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Perplexity AI, accusing the company of illegally scraping user content to train AI systems. The lawsuit also targets Lithuanian data firm Oxylabs, Texas-based SerpApi, and AWMProxy, alleging they provided scraping services while "masking their identities" and "disguising their scrapers as regular users."

### Meta AI Unit Restructuring

Meta cut approximately 600 positions from its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, affecting the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team and AI infrastructure units. The cuts come after the lukewarm reception of Meta's Llama 4 model and key personnel departures, as the company restructures its AI initiatives.

### US-China Tech Tensions

President Trump is considering sweeping export controls that could block software-based products from reaching China in retaliation for Beijing's rare earth export restrictions. The proposed measures would restrict global shipments of items made with US software, including laptops, semiconductors, and jet engines.

## Startup and Funding News

### Notable Funding Rounds

Several significant funding announcements emerged today:

- **Uniphore** raised \$260 million in Series F funding led by NVIDIA, AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks
- **Wonderland Foods** secured Rs 140 crore in its maiden funding round led by Asha Ventures and BII
- **Pave Bank** raised \$39 million in funding led by Accel


### WazirX Trading Restart

Cryptocurrency exchange WazirX announced plans to restart trading after a year-long hiatus following a \$235 million hack. The exchange is preparing to resume operations with enhanced security measures.

## Upcoming Events and Industry Impact

### AI Infrastructure and Energy Costs

Bank of America warns that the AI boom is driving utility costs higher for consumers, with "further upside ahead" as electricity supply struggles to meet growing data center demand. The Stargate Project alone plans to invest \$500 billion over four years in AI infrastructure development.

### TechCrunch Disrupt 2025

The final judges for Startup Battlefield 200 have been announced for TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, taking place October 27-29. The event will showcase emerging startups and innovation across various technology sectors.

This comprehensive overview captures the dynamic landscape of technology on October 23, 2025, highlighting major breakthroughs in quantum computing and AI, significant product launches, and ongoing industry challenges that are shaping the future of technology.
