GitHub has announced a suite of new AI-powered security features designed to help developers identify and fix vulnerabilities more efficiently. The new tools leverage machine learning to provide real-time security scanning and automated fix suggestions.

Key features include:

- **Smart Vulnerability Detection**: AI models trained on millions of repositories can identify security issues that traditional scanners might miss
- **Automated Fix Suggestions**: The system can propose specific code changes to address detected vulnerabilities
- **Context-Aware Scanning**: Security analysis takes into account the specific framework and dependencies used in each project

The rollout begins this month for GitHub Enterprise customers, with broader availability expected by early 2025.
