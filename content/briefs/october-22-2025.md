**Netflix Misses Q3 Earnings on Brazilian Tax Dispute**

Netflix reported Q3 2025 earnings on October 21 with adjusted EPS of \$5.87, missing analyst estimates of \$6.97. Revenue rose 17% year-over-year to \$11.51 billion, meeting expectations. The earnings shortfall was attributed to an unexpected \$619 million expense linked to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. Netflix's stock fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Despite the miss, Netflix highlighted record-breaking performance in its advertising sector, with plans to more than double ad revenue in 2025.

**Texas Instruments Beats Q3 Estimates but Issues Cautious Q4 Outlook**

Texas Instruments reported Q3 2025 earnings of \$1.48 per share on revenue of \$4.74 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year, with the Analog segment achieving 16% growth to \$3.73 billion. However, the company's Q4 guidance disappointed investors, with projected earnings between \$1.13 and \$1.39 per share and revenue between \$4.22 billion and \$4.58 billion, both below Wall Street estimates. TI cited macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from tariffs and industrial clients in "wait and see mode" as factors pressuring demand.
