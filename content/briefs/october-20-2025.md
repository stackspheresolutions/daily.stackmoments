## Tech News for October 20, 2025

### AWS Global Outage Disrupts Major Services

Amazon Web Services experienced a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, causing widespread disruption to numerous websites and applications worldwide. The outage, which originated from a DNS problem at AWS's data centers in North Virginia, affected popular services including Fortnite, Snapchat, Lyft, McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Robinhood, Venmo, Verizon, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Roblox, and Coinbase.

AWS confirmed elevated error rates and latencies for multiple services in the US-EAST-1 region within about two hours of the incident. The company reported "notable indications of recovery" and stated that most requests should be successful, though a backlog of pending requests remained. By around 3:03 AM PDT, certain services had returned to normal, with global services dependent on US-EAST-1 resuming operation.

The incident demonstrated the fragility of global tech infrastructure, as a single provider's disruption can ripple across the internet, affecting consumers and businesses worldwide. Airlines reported customers unable to locate reservations online, check in, or drop off luggage, while various cloud-based gaming platforms experienced interruptions.

### Apple Launches M5 Chip with Major AI Performance Leap

Apple unveiled the M5 chip on October 14, 2025, marking a significant advancement in AI performance for Apple silicon. Built using third-generation 3-nanometer technology, the M5 introduces a next-generation 10-core GPU architecture with a Neural Accelerator in each core, delivering over 4x the peak GPU compute performance for AI compared to M4.

The new chip features the world's fastest performance core, with up to a 10-core CPU (six efficiency cores and up to four performance cores), delivering up to 15% faster multithreaded performance over M4. The M5 also includes an improved 16-core Neural Engine and nearly 30% increase in unified memory bandwidth to 153GB/s.

Apple announced that the M5 brings its industry-leading power-efficient performance to the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, all available for pre-order starting October 14, 2025. The company is expected to hold announcements for additional products later in October, including the M5 MacBook Air, AirTag 2, Apple TV with A17 Pro chip, and HomePod mini 2.

### iPhone 17 Outsells iPhone 16 by 14% in Early Sales

Apple's iPhone 17 series outperformed its predecessor by 14% during the first 10 days of availability in the United States and China, according to Counterpoint Research. The base model iPhone 17 nearly doubled in sales in China compared to the iPhone 16 during the same period, with overall sales of the standard model rising 31% across both markets.
Senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang attributed the success to the "great value for money" offered by the base iPhone 17, which features a better chip, improved display, higher base storage, and selfie camera upgrade—all at the same price as last year's iPhone 16. In the United States, the iPhone 17 Pro Max experienced heightened demand, with major carriers increasing maximum subsidies by approximately $100 to attract buyers.

### WhatsApp to Ban General-Purpose AI Chatbots

Meta updated its WhatsApp Business API policy to prohibit general-purpose AI chatbots from operating on the platform, effective January 15, 2026. The new terms specifically ban "AI Providers" from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution when AI technologies serve as the primary functionality.

This policy change affects AI assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity, Luzia, and Poke, which had been operating on WhatsApp. The ban will make Meta AI the only general-purpose AI chatbot accessible through WhatsApp, which has over 500 million users in India. However, businesses using AI for customer service, such as travel agencies deploying chatbots for support, will not be affected by the change.

Meta cited heavy traffic and infrastructure strain as reasons for the decision, noting that AI chatbots were sending a huge number of messages without fitting into WhatsApp's paid business model.

### Wikipedia Loses 8% of Human Traffic to AI and Social Media

The Wikimedia Foundation reported an 8% year-over-year decline in human pageviews to Wikipedia, revealed after updating its bot detection systems in May 2025. The decline reflects the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information, particularly as search engines increasingly use AI to provide answers directly without linking to sites like Wikipedia.

Marshall Miller, senior director of product at the Wikimedia Foundation, explained that AI chatbots and search engines now use Wikipedia's content to answer questions instantly, meaning people often obtain Wikipedia-sourced facts without visiting the site. A Columbia Business School study found clear evidence that readership declined for Wikipedia articles whose content closely resembles ChatGPT's output.

The decline poses challenges for Wikipedia's volunteer-driven model and donation-based funding, as falling traffic could affect volunteer growth and contributions. The foundation is responding by improving editing tools, building better mobile features, and expanding projects for young audiences on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Roblox, and Instagram.

### Samsung Galaxy Z Tri-Fold to Be Showcased at APEC Summit

Samsung is preparing to showcase its first tri-fold smartphone at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea on October 31-November 1, 2025. The device, expected to be called the Galaxy Z Tri-Fold, will be displayed under glass during the high-profile exhibition highlighting South Korea's technological innovations.

The tri-fold phone features two hinges allowing it to fold out into a tablet-sized screen or fold back into a standard smartphone form. It is expected to pack a 10-inch OLED inner display with the two ends folding inwards, along with a 6.5-inch cover screen. The device will likely be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip and feature a 200MP primary sensor in a triple camera setup.

Samsung is reportedly targeting a commercial launch before the end of 2025, with initial production of around 50,000 units and limited sales starting in South Korea, China, and possibly the United States. The device is expected to be priced around $3,000 (approximately ₹2,64,000).

### Zoho Rolls Out Free Agentic AI Features

Zoho announced the implementation of new agentic AI features embedded across its major product categories on October 16, 2025. The AI-powered features are designed to automate routine processes and integrate seamlessly with company data at no additional cost for users of specific Zoho apps.

The new capabilities span Zoho Workplace (including Zoho Mail, Zoho Cliq, Zoho Sheets, and Zoho Tables), Zoho CRM, Zoho Recruit, and Zoho Desk. Features include lead creation from unread emails, AI-generated databases, candidate-role matching and assessment generation, and resolution documentation.

Zoho's rollout comes amid the company's growing popularity in India, driven by the central government's campaign to promote "Swadeshi" or Made-in-India products and services. Several ministers including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Health Minister JP Nadda, and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw have publicly announced switching to Zoho Mail and Zoho Workspace tools for official work.

### Google CEO Admits OpenAI Beat Google to ChatGPT Launch

Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference on October 17, 2025, that OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022 caught Google off guard, despite the company's long-standing leadership in AI. Pichai admitted that while Google had been developing its own AI chatbot, OpenAI "put it out first".

When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it triggered a "code red" within Google, with Pichai redirecting several teams to accelerate AI development efforts. Pichai explained that Google's chatbot wasn't ready for public release at the time, as it still faced issues that needed fixing before meeting the company's standards.

The Google CEO emphasized that the company had already been making major investments in AI, including developing its own chips and infrastructure to support large-scale AI research. Pichai also announced plans to release Gemini 3.0, the next version of Google's AI model, later in 2025.

### OpenAI Orders Hundreds of Billions in AI Chips

OpenAI committed to acquiring 26 gigawatts worth of sophisticated data processors from Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom in less than a month—more than 10 million units that would consume power equivalent to 20 standard nuclear reactors. The massive chip orders raise questions about how the startup will finance these purchases, as OpenAI doesn't expect to be profitable until 2029 despite generating about $13 billion in revenue.

On October 13, 2025, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to design and deploy custom AI chips starting in the latter half of 2026, with plans to introduce 10 gigawatts of customized chips. This followed earlier announcements of a 6-gigawatt AI chip agreement with AMD and Nvidia's plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI.

Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, stated, "They will need hundreds of billions of dollars to live up to their obligations," highlighting the financial challenge facing OpenAI.

### Elon Musk Claims SpaceX Will Carry 90% of Global Payload

Elon Musk claimed that SpaceX will handle approximately 90% of the world's payload mass launched to orbit in 2025, positioning the company as "Earth's space program". Musk shared a chart showing SpaceX already accounted for over 90% of global payload mass in the second quarter of 2025, driven primarily by Falcon 9 launches.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded to Musk's announcement with "Incredible to see!!" with Musk replying with a heart emoji. SpaceX's dominance is primarily driven by its reusable Falcon 9 rocket technology, which enables cost-effective, high-cadence launches.

Musk also stated that with increased launch cadence of the Starship rocket, SpaceX could deliver over 95% of total Earth payload to orbit next year, possibly reaching 98% by 2027.

The December batch will include OnePlus 11 5G, 11R 5G, Nord 5, Nord CE5, Nord 4, and Nord 3 5G.

### Ola CEO Booked in Employee Suicide Case

Bengaluru police registered a case against Ola Electric CEO Bhavish Aggarwal and other senior officials on October 6, 2025, following the death by suicide of 38-year-old engineer K. Aravind on September 28. Aravind, who worked as a homologation engineer at Ola Electric since 2022, allegedly left a 28-page handwritten note accusing his superiors of mental harassment and non-payment of salary and allowances.

The complaint, filed by Aravind's brother Ashwin Kannan, noted that ₹17.46 lakh was transferred to Aravind's bank account through NEFT on September 30, two days after his death, which the family termed as suspicious. The police registered the case under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Section 108 (abetment of suicide).

Ola Electric responded that it has challenged the FIR registration before the Karnataka High Court, with protective orders passed in favor of the company and its officials. This marks the second case of death by suicide involving Ola Group employees within six months.

Lionel Messi scored his second career MLS hat-trick on October 18, 2025, leading Inter Miami to a 5-2 victory over Nashville SC on MLS Decision Day. With three goals and an assist, Messi finished the 2025 regular season with 48 goal contributions (29 goals, 19 assists), the second-most in a single season in MLS history, just one behind Carlos Vela's record of 49 in 2019.

Messi secured the MLS Golden Boot as the league's top scorer with 29 goals, ahead of Denis Bouanga of LAFC and Sam Surridge of Nashville, both with 24 goals. Inter Miami finished the regular season with a 19-7-8 record (65 points), securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The team will face sixth-seeded Nashville in the opening round of the playoffs.

### Meesho Files for December 2025 IPO

Meesho filed its updated draft red herring prospectus (UDRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on October 18, 2025, targeting a December 2025 listing on Indian bourses. The Bengaluru-based e-commerce platform plans to raise approximately ₹5,800-6,600 crore ($700-800 million) through the offering, which includes a primary issue of ₹4,250 crore ($500 million).

The offering will mark the first pure-play horizontal e-commerce marketplace listing in India. Early investors including Elevation Capital, Peak XV Partners, Venture Highway, and Y Combinator are expected to partially exit through the offering for sale (OFS). Elevation Capital owns 14% stake, while Peak XV Partners owns 13.2%, with other major investors including SoftBank, Prosus, WestBridge Capital, and Fidelity.

### IT Sector Shows Demand Stabilization Signs

India's IT services sector is showing tentative signs of demand stabilization, though visibility into calendar year 2026 remains poor, according to a Goldman Sachs report released on October 19, 2025. All major IT firms reported sequential revenue growth in the latest quarter, with the sector expanding 1.5% quarter-on-quarter.

The December 2025 quarter is expected to see a continuation of this positive momentum, with an estimated 1.7% sequential rise in services revenue. However, for the full financial year 2026, revenue growth is expected to remain muted at around 1.1% year-on-year, improving to about 5.4% in FY27.

The report attributes the cautious outlook to subdued client spending amid macroeconomic uncertainties and the ongoing impact of AI-driven productivity gains, which are beginning to compress traditional growth avenues.

### 1990s Infosys Canteen Video Goes Viral

A video showing the Infosys canteen in Bengaluru during the 1990s went viral on social media, garnering over four million views and sparking nostalgia for India's early IT industry days. The grainy footage shows young employees chatting over lunch without mobile phones, evoking memories of what many called the "golden era" of India's IT sector.

Social media users praised the simplicity and optimism captured in the video, noting everyone appeared "relaxed," "fit," and engaged in genuine conversation without digital distractions. One former Infosys employee from that period recalled the company's "Catch Them Young" program, where school students were invited to learn coding from engineers.

The video sparked reflections on how much India's corporate life has evolved, with many contrasting the cheerful, gadget-free canteen scene with today's stressful office culture.
