Additionally, NVIDIA introduced NVQLink, an open architecture for coupling GPU computing with quantum processors to build accelerated quantum supercomputers, with 17 quantum builders and nine scientific labs already participating.

**AI Investment and Market Dynamics**

Prominent investors expressed diverging views on AI valuations. Ray Dalio warned of a risky AI market bubble forming around major tech companies, though he suggested it may persist until the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy. His bubble indicator reached elevated levels, with 80% of market gains concentrated in Big Tech. Conversely, Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia dismissed AI bubble concerns, stating there is "real value" in AI as demand far outpaces supply. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest highlighted humanoid robots as potentially "the biggest of all" AI opportunities within embodied AI.

**Enterprise AI Growth**

India's IT and AI services market is projected to reach \$400 billion by 2030, driven by AI-first startups reshaping traditional outsourcing models. AI-startup funding in India grew 50% to approximately \$665 million in the first eight months of 2025. Meanwhile, Mem0 raised \$24 million in Series A funding to build a "memory layer" for AI applications, addressing the challenge that large language models cannot retain context across interactions.
